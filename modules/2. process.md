# IAC Energy Assessment Center Process Guidelines

The following guidelines are designed to describe the process of a typical Industrial Assessment Center (IAC) energy assessment center in the performance, creation, and delivery of the primary products of the IAC program: the industrial assessment and the industrial assessment report.

## Scope of Industrial Assessments

The Industrial Assessment Center (IAC) is an energy center based in the engineering department of a major University, supported by the Industrial Technologies Program at the US Department of Energy. The IAC team is comprised of one (or more) professors and engineering students. One of these students is designated the report lead and another the safety lead. The typical IAC industrial assessment is expected to be conducted in one day. The resultant Assessment Report is designed to help medium-sized manufacturers identify ways to save energy, reduce waste, and improve productivity while providing engineering students with hands-on training in manufacturing plants.

## IAC Protocol

### STEP 1: Pre-Assessment Information Gathering

The client is sent a Pre-assessment Form. This form includes:

- Size of Plant and plant layout
- Industry type (SIC/ NAICS code) and process description
- Production levels, units and dollars, operating hours
- A one-year history of utility bills
- List of major energy-consuming equipment

### STEP 2: Ensure that Key Plant Personnel are Involved

Key plant personnel includes:

- Plant manager
- Energy manager
- Environmental personnel
- Maintenance personnel

### STEP 3: Pre-Assessment Analysis

Pre-assessment analysis involves:

- Analyzing the manufacturing process
- Charting and graphing utility bills
- Analyzing utility bills for trends and errors; establishing the unit cost of energy
- Starting a Plant profile using QuickPEP
- Identifying key energy systems
- Reviewing design and other technical documentations
- Identifying possible energy-saving potential recommendations using the IAC database
- Developing an Assessment Day Strategy

### STEP 4: Day of the Assessment

The assessment day includes:

#### Introduction

- History of the IAC program, ITP, and BestPractices
- Distribution of BP tools, case studies, tip sheets
- Description of manufacturing process and operations
- Assessment of whether it is a typical day
- Running through the process following material flow
- Discussion of inventory levels
- Questions about defects, bottlenecks, and waste materials
- Presentation of charts and tables of utility bills

#### Plant Tour

- Conducting the tour in the direction of the material flow
- Plant Manager conducting the tour
- Only one person asking questions
- Conceptual tour, no data taken

#### Meeting Room Debriefing

- Discussing the process and asking questions
- Developing and planning for the afternoon
- Creating specific tasks and dividing into teams
- Reviewing notes and brainstorming (Lunch)
- Developing a list of potential energy-saving opportunities
- Ensuring everyone understands the process and potential recommendations
- Refining the list of opportunities to be investigated
- Deciding what information needs to be gathered, measured, monitored
- Assigning teams to specific tasks
- Making plans to meet at an assigned time and place

#### Data Gathering

- Conducting measurements, monitoring, and diagnostic testing on motor systems, heat processes, cooling processes, water use and pumps, ventilation, compressed air, building systems, and delivery and distribution systems

#### Exit Interview

- Discussing findings with management
- Providing a preliminary estimate of potential savings
- Prioritizing recommendations of analysis

### STEP 5: Post-Assessment Activities

- Conducting engineering and financial analysis
- Developing first-order estimates of implementation cost
- Delivering the report to the client and uploading data to the IAC database

## Contents of an IAC Report

- Executive Summary including a summary of Recommendations
- Plant Description
- Process Description
- Resource Charts and Tables
- Major Energy Consuming Equipment
- Best Practices
- Description of Individual Energy Saving Recommendations

## Follow-up to Report

- Calling the client two weeks after delivery to answer questions
- Calling the client in 6-9 months for implementation data
- Uploading data to the IAC database
- Inquiring about the potential for a Case Study of the project(s)
