# IAC Program History

Industrial Assessment Centers (formerly called the Energy Analysis and Diagnostic Centers) were created by the Department of Commerce in 1976 in response to the oil embargo and rising energy costs. The program was specifically focused on helping small and medium-sized manufacturing facilities cut back on unnecessary costs from inefficient energy use.

The IAC program was moved to the Department of Energy just after it was formed in 1978 and was later expanded to include evaluations of ineffective production procedures, excess waste production, and other production-related problems. More recent additions to the IAC program scope include improving cybersecurity awareness, exploring smart manufacturing technologies, and implementing comprehensive energy management systems.

Currently, the IAC program is administered through the Advanced Manufacturing Office under the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy at the Department of Energy.

# About Us

The Southern New England Industrial Assessment Center, based at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, is a U.S. Department of Energy-funded initiative to offer free and comprehensive energy audits to eligible small-to-medium manufacturers. The IAC program is administered through the Advanced Manufacturing Office, under the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy at the DOE.

Our mission is to provide energy audit and consulting services to small-to-medium enterprises, train students in improving industrial energy efficiency, and provide outreach and education opportunities to nonparticipating manufacturers in the CT/RI/NYC/Long Island area.

# Mission

The mission of our center is:

- To offer free and comprehensive audit and consulting services to small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) for saving energy, reducing water usage, minimizing industrial waste, strengthening cyber security, reducing carbon footprint, adopting renewable energy, and improving productivity;
- To train students in improving industrial energy efficiency through hands-on, real-world experience by conducting student team assessments of SMEs; and
- To provide outreach and education opportunities to nonparticipating SMEs. 

The proposed IAC will focus its service on the dense Southern New England/Southern NY (sNE/sNY) regions, including Connecticut, Rhode Island, Long Island, New York City, and southeastern New York, and can serve a 150-mile radius from both sites.
