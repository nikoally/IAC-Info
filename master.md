# IAC Energy Assessment Center Process Guidelines

The following guidelines are designed to describe the process of a typical Industrial Assessment Center (IAC) energy assessment center in the performance, creation, and delivery of the primary products of the IAC program: the industrial assessment and the industrial assessment report.

## Scope of Industrial Assessments

The Industrial Assessment Center (IAC) is an energy center based in the engineering department of a major University, supported by the Industrial Technologies Program at the US Department of Energy. The IAC team is comprised of one (or more) professors and engineering students. One of these students is designated the report lead and another the safety lead. The typical IAC industrial assessment is expected to be conducted in one day. The resultant Assessment Report is designed to help medium-sized manufacturers identify ways to save energy, reduce waste, and improve productivity while providing engineering students with hands-on training in manufacturing plants.

# Understanding Cybersecurity in Manufacturing

As systems to control energy-using manufacturing equipment become more connected to the internet, it is important for plant operations staff to have an understanding of cybersecurity risks and to coordinate risk management activities within their organization.

Small businesses may not consider themselves targets for cyber-attacks. However, they have valuable information cyber criminals seek, such as employee and customer records, bank account information, and access to larger networks. They can be at a higher risk for cybersecurity attack because they have fewer resources dedicated to cybersecurity.

By addressing risk areas, you can protect your business from damage to information or systems, intellectual property theft, regulatory fines/penalties, decreased productivity, or a loss of trust with customers.

## IAC Cybersecurity Assessments

Industrial Assessment Centers work with manufacturing clients to increase awareness of cybersecurity risks and potential mitigation activities. As part of facility site visits, IAC clients may elect to receive cybersecurity risk assessments to identify security and privacy deficiencies to the business infrastructure, with a focus on vulnerabilities associated with industrial controls systems.

The IAC Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Assessment Tool includes 20 simple questions to characterize industrial controls systems and plant operations. The tool then provides a high level assessment of risk (high, medium, or low). The companion User Guide provides additional context for the questions included in the tool, to help clients understand how certain business practices lead to cybersecurity risk. Upon conclusion of the assessment, the tool generates a customized list of action items associated with the risks identified. For additional guidance, IACs refer clients to additional technical resource materials available through the NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) and other organizations.

## Cybersecurity Fundamentals for Small and Medium Sized Manufacturers

Most plant operations managers are not cybersecurity experts, but can benefit from a basic understanding of cybersecurity risks and mitigation activities. A guidance document provided by NIST, [NIST Small Business Information Security: The Fundamentals](https://www.example.com/NIST), provides a thorough and easily readable overview of cybersecurity basics.

As a first step, organizations need to understand their cybersecurity risks, to determine where the organization is vulnerable and may be subject to disruption of systems and processes. Organizations can use helpful checklists from the NIST document, or other cybersecurity assessment tools, to conduct the following activities:

- Identify what information your business stores and uses
- Determine the value of your information
- Develop an inventory of technologies used to store and process information
- Understand your threats and vulnerabilities

Once risks are understood, organizations can determine appropriate mitigation activities. Example activities are shown below, grouped into the five broad categories of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework:

### IDENTIFY
- Identify and control who has access to your business information
- Conduct background checks
- Require individual user accounts for each employee
- Create policies and procedures for information security

### PROTECT
- Limit employee access to data and information
- Install surge protectors and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS)
- Patch your operating systems and applications
- Install and activate software and hardware firewalls on all your business networks
- Secure your wireless access point and networks
- Set up web and email filters
- Use encryption for sensitive business information
- Dispose of old computers and media safely
- Train your employees

### DETECT
- Install and update anti-virus, -spyware, and other –malware programs
- Maintain and monitor logs

### RESPOND
- Develop a plan for disasters and information security incidents

### RECOVER
- Make full backups of important business data/information
- Make incremental backups of important business data/information
- Consider cyber insurance
- Make improvements to processes/procedures/technologies

# IAC Program History

Industrial Assessment Centers (formerly called the Energy Analysis and Diagnostic Centers) were created by the Department of Commerce in 1976 in response to the oil embargo and rising energy costs. The program was specifically focused on helping small and medium-sized manufacturing facilities cut back on unnecessary costs from inefficient energy use.

The IAC program was moved to the Department of Energy just after it was formed in 1978 and was later expanded to include evaluations of ineffective production procedures, excess waste production, and other production-related problems. More recent additions to the IAC program scope include improving cybersecurity awareness, exploring smart manufacturing technologies, and implementing comprehensive energy management systems.

Currently, the IAC program is administered through the Advanced Manufacturing Office under the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy at the Department of Energy.
